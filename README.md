# CancerGuard-A-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Lung-Cancer-Detection

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality
around the world, requiring headways in early discovery methods to progress
understanding results. This study explores the efficacy of deep learning models,
particularly InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2, within the detection and
classification of lung cancer through histopathology images. Utilizing a dataset
comprising various lung cancer subtypes, these models were trained and validated, demonstrating amazing diagnostic accuracy. The results highlight the potential of deep learning to enhance lung cancer diagnostics significantly, outperforming conventional diagnostic strategies in both speed and precision. This paper discusses the models' performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1
score, and overall accuracy, which substantiate the robustness and reliability of
deep learning in medical imaging. The dataset was open source which contains
15000 images and the accuracy of the proposed model is 99%. The findings advocate for the integration of deep learning technologies in clinical settings to encourage early and exact lung cancer location, subsequently possibly expanding
survival rates.
